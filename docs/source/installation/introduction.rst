Introduction
============

Installing saltant can roughly be divided into two sets of steps:
hosting a development server locally, and hosting a production server on
a network.

Running a development server is fairly straightforward in the sense that
you can follow the steps here without thinking too much. Running a
production server is less straightforward in the sense that *what* steps
you take and *how* you take them depend on your production environment
and project requirements. Hence, you can read the development server
instructions as *the* way to host saltant locally, while you should
read the production server instructions as *a* way to host saltant in
production.

One other note: saltant was designed with security in mind. With that
said, improper setup can result in compromisable security. With *that*
said, security considerations will be mentioned and made obvious in the
installation instructions.
